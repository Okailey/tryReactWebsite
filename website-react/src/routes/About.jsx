                    Hi! I'm Danielle Quaye, pursuing a <strong>Computer Science degree at Mount Holyoke College</strong> with a passion for creating innovative solutions with the aim of helping others. My interests lie <strong>in software development, product management, artificial intelligence and robotics</strong>. Originally from Ghana, I bring a unique perspective and dedication to my work, aiming to build technology that can make a real impact in society.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I have hands-on experience <strong>developing web applications</strong>, software design and I'm always eager to learn new tools and techniques to expand my skills. Recently, Iâ€™ve had the opportunity to explore <strong>motion planning with Duckiebots</strong>, which has deepened my interest in robotics and autonomous systems. This experience has taught me to solve complex challenges creatively, blending my technical knowledge with problem-solving skills.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Through these projects I have gained experience with <strong>Python, Flask, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, Java, Swift, and C#</strong>.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I love this path I have chosen because I find joy in seeing a smile on the face of others when something I have contributed to or created has impacted their lives positively. Whether it is creating solutions to solve global challenges or improve the lives of people with efficient algorithms or creating user-friendly applications, I want to make a positive impact and that is what drives me.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I look forward to applying my skills in collaborative and challenging environments, contributing to projects that make a difference in people's lives.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Outside of coding and the world of technology, I enjoy playing <strong>tennis</strong> and volunteering in Dennis Tennis Serving Love Nonprofit to inspire and mentor unprivileged children who are interested in tennis.
